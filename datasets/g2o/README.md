# g2o MIT datasets

The files in this directory are taken from https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/datasets/

- `parking-garage.g2o`: This file is reported in [2] to come from [vertigo](https://openslam-org.github.io/vertigo.html) ([1]),
  which in turn says the files come from [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) [3],
  but this author (JLBC) could not find them in this repository anymore.
  Anyhow, we retain the same license of g2o for these dataset files in the absence of a clearer source:

      g2o is licensed under the BSD License.
